> The Safavid dynasty (; Persian: دودمان صفوی, romanized: Dudmân-e Safavi, 
> pronounced [d̪uːd̪ˈmɒːne sæfæˈviː]) 
> was the ruling dynasty of Safavid Iran, and one of Iran's most significant ruling dynasties 
> reigning from 1501 to 1736. 
> 
> Their rule is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history, 
> as well as one of the gunpowder empires. 
> 
> The Safavid Shah Ismail I established the Twelver denomination of Shi'a Islam 
> as the official religion of the Persian Empire, 
> marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. 
> 
> The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid Sufi order, 
> which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Iranian Azerbaijan region. 
> 
> It was an Iranian dynasty of Kurdish origin, but during their rule they intermarried 
> with Turkoman, Georgian, Circassian, and Pontic Greek dignitaries; 
> nevertheless, for practical purposes, they were not only Persian-speaking, 
> but also Turkish-speaking and Turkified. 
> 
> From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran 
> and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, 
> thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire 
> to establish a national state officially known as Iran.
>
> The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 
> (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736 and 1750 to 1773) 
> and, at their height, controlled all of what is now Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Armenia, eastern Georgia, parts of the North Caucasus including Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, 
> as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
>
> Despite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind 
> was the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, 
> the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon "checks and balances", 
> their architectural innovations, and patronage for fine arts. 
> 
> The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era 
> by establishing Twelver Shi'ism as the state religion of Iran, 
> as well as spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Middle East, 
> Central Asia, Caucasus, Anatolia, the Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia.
