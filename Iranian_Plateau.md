## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Iranian plateau or Persian plateau is a geological feature 
> spanning parts of the Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and West Asia. 
> 
> It makes up part of the Eurasian plate, 
> and is wedged between the Arabian plate and the Indian plate. 
> The plateau is situated between the Zagros Mountains to the west, the Caspian Sea 
> and the Köpet Dag to the north, the Armenian Highlands 
> and the Caucasus Mountains to the northwest, 
> the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf to the south, 
> and the Indian subcontinent to the southeast.
>
> As a historical region, it includes Parthia, Media, Persis, 
> and some of the previous territories of Greater Iran. 
> The Zagros form the plateau's western boundary, 
> and its eastern slopes may also be included in the term. 
> 
> The Encyclopædia Britannica excludes "lowland Khuzestan" explicitly 
> and characterizes Elam as spanning "the region from the Mesopotamian plain to the Iranian Plateau".
>
> From the Caspian Sea in the northwest to the Sulaiman Mountains in the southeast, 
> the Iranian Plateau extends for close to 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi). 
> 
> It encompasses the majority of Iran, all of Afghanistan, 
> and the parts of Pakistan that are situated to the west of the Indus River,  
> covering an area of some 3,700,000 square kilometres (1,400,000 sq mi) 
> 
> In spite of being called a plateau, it is far from flat, and contains several mountain ranges; 
> its highest point is Noshaq in the Hindu Kush at 7,492 metres (24,580 ft), 
> and its lowest point is the Lut Desert to the east of Kerman, Iran, at below 300 metres (980 ft).
