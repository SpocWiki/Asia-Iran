> **Elam** was an ancient civilization centered in the far west and southwest of Iran, 
> stretching from the lowlands of what is now Khuzestan and Ilam Province 
> as well as a small part of modern-day southern Iraq. 
> 
> The modern name Elam stems from the Sumerian transliteration elam(a), 
> along with the later Akkadian elamtu, and the Elamite haltamti. 
> Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the Ancient Near East. 
> In classical literature, Elam was also known as Susiana (Ancient Greek: Σουσιανή Sousiānḗ), 
> a name derived from its capital Susa.
>
> Elam was part of the early urbanization of the Near East during the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age). 
> The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, 
> where slightly earlier records have been found. 
> 
> In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), 
> Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, 
> and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. 
> 
> Its culture played a crucial role during the Persian Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded Elam, 
> when the Elamite language remained among those in official use. 
> Elamite is generally considered a language isolate or unrelated to any other languages. 
> 
> According to Daniel T. Potts, Walther Hinz was less cautious 
> in suggesting that the Elamites were ‘Proto-Lurs’ — 
> that is, ancestors of the inhabitants of modern-day Lurestan in western Iran.
